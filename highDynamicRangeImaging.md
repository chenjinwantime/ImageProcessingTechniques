## Books
### General Introdution
 - [High dynamic range imaging: acquisition, display, and image-based lighting](https://books.google.com.tw/books?hl=zh-TW&lr=&id=w1i_1kejoYcC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=High+dynamic+range+imaging:+acquisition,+display,+and+image-based+lighting.&ots=4i-28zQHpB&sig=7ImiQtgMxdPvwtMPQQIYMyiBfn8&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=High%20dynamic%20range%20imaging%3A%20acquisition%2C%20display%2C%20and%20image-based%20lighting.&f=false)
	+ Reinhard, Erik, et al. ,2010
	+ The bible of the HDR imaging

## Courses

## Papers
### HDR image reconstruction
- Debevec, Paul E., and Jitendra Malik. "Recovering high dynamic range radiance maps from photographs." ACM SIGGRAPH 2008 classes. ACM, 2008.
	+ The basic but effective method for HDR image reconstruction
	+ Matrix form solution(including least square term and smoothness term)

### Tone mapping

### Alternative to HDR imaging
- Exposure Fusion
	+ Two series of paper
		+ Mertens, Tom, Jan Kautz, and Frank Van Reeth. "Exposure fusion." Computer Graphics and Applications, 2007. PG'07. 15th Pacific Conference on. IEEE, 2007.
		+ Mertens, Tom, Jan Kautz, and Frank Van Reeth. "Exposure fusion: A simple and practical alternative to high dynamic range photography." Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 28. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2009.
			+ Scalar-weighted map is first generated based on the quality measurement (contrast, saturation, well-exposedness) of the exposure bracketed image, then the fusion is performed in the multiresolution manner (Gaussian pyramids of the weighted map and Laplacian pyramids of the original image)
